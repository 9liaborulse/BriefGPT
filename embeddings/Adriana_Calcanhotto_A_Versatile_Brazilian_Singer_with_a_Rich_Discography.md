Adriana Calcanhotto (formerly Calcanhoto) is a singer and composer who was born in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, in 1965. Her father was a jazz drummer who influenced her musical taste and encouraged her to sing and play guitar. She moved to Rio de Janeiro in the late 1980s and started performing in small bars and clubs. In 1990, she released her debut album, EnguiÃ§o, which featured songs by renowned Brazilian composers such as LupicÃ­nio Rodrigues, Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo Bastos, as well as her own compositions and covers of rock hits by Os TitÃ£s and The Beatles.
 
Her second album, Senhas, came out in 1992 and brought her national recognition, thanks to the inclusion of the title track on the soundtrack of a popular soap opera. The album also showcased her versatility as a songwriter, with songs ranging from pop to samba, from bossa nova to rock. Her third album, A FÃ¡brica do Poema, released in 1994, was even more eclectic and adventurous, featuring collaborations with avant-garde poet Augusto de Campos and legendary multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal. The album also contained some of her most successful songs, such as "Esquadros", "Mentiras" and "Inverno".
 
In 1998, Adriana Calcanhotto surprised her fans with Maritmo, an album that explored the theme of the sea and incorporated elements of electronic music, ska, funk and maracatu. The album included guest appearances by Dorival Caymmi and Arnaldo Antunes, as well as a reinterpretation of Roberto Carlos' "Porisso eu Corro Demais". In 2000, she recorded PÃºblico, a live album that captured her charisma and energy on stage. The album featured songs from her previous albums as well as new versions of classics by Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso and Vinicius de Moraes.
 
After PÃºblico, Adriana Calcanhotto embarked on a series of albums dedicated to children's music, under the pseudonym Adriana Partimpim. She released three albums in this vein: Adriana Partimpim (2004), Adriana Partimpim - O Show (2005) and Partimpim TlÃªs (2012). These albums were not only aimed at kids, but also appealed to adults who appreciated her playful and inventive approach to music. She also recorded songs for animated movies such as The Boy and the World (2013) and Tito and the Birds (2018).
 
In 2008, Adriana Calcanhotto returned to her adult-oriented repertoire with MarÃ©, a sequel to Maritmo that continued her exploration of the sea as a metaphor for life. The album featured songs by Jorge Ben Jor, Gilberto Gil and Tom Jobim, among others. In 2015, she released Olhos de Onda, an EP that marked her debut as a producer. The EP contained four songs that reflected her intimate and minimalist style. In 2018, she released Margem, another sequel to Maritmo that completed her trilogy about the sea. The album was inspired by her experience of living in Portugal for two years and featured collaborations with Rubel, Banda DidÃ¡ and Antonio Zambujo.
